# function-checklist
A checklist and tracker for JavaScript functions, that helps users track which functions they currently have, if they have been called, and create a short description about what the function does and calls, based on user input and selected elements.

Users are prompted to give their function a name, and a brief description about what it does.
From there they may select the type of function it is, the scope of the function, and additional attributes the function may have.
Afterwards users may save the function, at which point it will become available to them as an item in their tracker list, which can be viewed more thoroughly, edited, and/or deleted.
