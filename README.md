# function-checklist

FuncTastic
A checklist and tracker for JavaScript functions, that helps users track which functions they currently have, if they have been called, and create a short description about what the function does and calls, based on user input and selected elements.
This porject was made in the hope to help new developers be able to track and troublshoot their functions with ease. This project was wireframed in FIGMA, with our main code being written in Visual Studio Code, and bootstrap being utilized for certain CSS and functionality elements.


Functastic is currently a web-based project, requiring users to access the FuncTastic website to use. We hope to impliment it as an extension to code editor applications such as VS Code in the future.
Currently you can access the project at this website : https://raeofchey.github.io/function-checklist/

Users are prompted to give their function a name, and a brief description about what it does.

From there they may select the type of function it is, the scope of the function, and additional attributes the function may have.
Afterwards users may save the function, at which point it will become available to them as an item in their tracker list, which can be viewed more thoroughly, edited, and/or deleted.
